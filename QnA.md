How long did this assignment take?
>Approximately 6 hours

What was the hardest part?
>Setting up JWTs without any knowledge on what JWTs are beforehand.

Did you learn anything new?
All of these are things I hadn't done before, but needed to learn for this assignment:
> - Setting up an API in .Net
> - Setting up and Using PostgreSQL for databases
> - Setting up and making use of JWTs for authorization

Is there anything you would have liked to implement but didn't have the time to?
>Multiple things, but I would have liked to clean up the code/project a bit more, as it is currently a not-so-clean mish-mesh of tutorials and my own interpretations.

What are the security holes (if any) in your system? If there are any, how would you fix them?
>My passwords aren't hashed and salted, so that would be my nr. 1 priority to fix if I cared about security.
>Besides that, it might be wise to look into whether SQL-injection attacks are a risk factor in this method.


Do you feel that your skills were well tested?
>Considering I had to figure out basically every aspect of this assignment from scratch, I'd say it was a great test in thinking on my feet (and my ability to Google/YouTube efficiently).
>Based on the information I had received from Ralf about his tasks at work, I expected a more SQL-focused / front-end-oriented assignment, but I thoroughly enjoyed trying something new!
